Excellent progress! Let me create a summary of what we've built so far and show you the current structure:
🎉 Progress Update - File Uploader Package
✅ Completed (13/56 tasks):
Phase 1: Package Setup ✅
Created complete package structure in packages/nestjs-file-uploader
Configured package.json with all dependencies
Set up TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest
Added package to monorepo workspaces in root package.json:9
Phase 2: Database Entities ✅
Created File entity with:
Full metadata support (name, path, size, mimetype, storage type)
Soft delete columns (deletedAt, deletedBy)
Folder relations
Tags, description, checksum fields
JSON metadata column
Created Folder entity with:
Tree structure (closure-table pattern)
Parent-child relationships
Soft delete support
File count and total size tracking
Phase 3: Strategy Pattern Implementation ✅
Created IStorageStrategy interface with:
upload/uploadMultiple
delete/deleteMultiple
get, exists, getMetadata
getSignedUrl
copy, move operations
Implemented 4 Storage Strategies:
LocalStorageStrategy - Server filesystem storage
AWSS3Strategy - Full AWS S3 integration with signed URLs
DigitalOceanStrategy - S3-compatible with CDN support
LinuxFolderStrategy - Linux-specific with permissions & symlink support

🚀 Next Steps:
We still have 43 tasks remaining. The next phase is to create:
Storage Factory - To dynamically select storage strategy
DTOs - For validation and API contracts
Services - Business logic layer
Controllers - REST API endpoints
Configuration Module - For dynamic module setup
Would you like me to:
Continue building (I'll create the Storage Factory and DTOs next)
Test the current code (Install dependencies and build)
Review what we have so far in detail
Something else?
What would you prefer?
start doing them one by one
Perfect! Let me continue building one by one. Starting with the Storage Factory:
